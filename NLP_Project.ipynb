Next issue is the size of the set screw, I have a screwdriver set with tons of bits so I had the small enough size but most people don't, you could perhaps switch to a philips and then most would have a bit or include a screw driver. Or an even better idea, WHY NOT SEND IT WITH BIT INSTALLED?  And I had a difficult time trying to use the letter template, I just got frustrated. The bit that is included is great and I was able to lable my tools but when the DIAMOND BIT, I was very pleased, I am able to mark my tools no matter how hard with my last name in a nice clean cursive with out fighting the bit bounce from hardened steel.  The instructions are also sorely lacking in detail.  Had those issues been not been there I would have given it five stars.  How about a little compartment on the tool to store extra bits?</td>\n",

I've gotten several comments both from people that get the reference to the 1987 Movie and people that just like the look of it. Appears well made and clear, slightly darker then picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "4999  Here are three issues, one the included tip was so hard to find, (it is in a slot in front of package) that I thought mine was missing so I order two more.  Next issue is the size of the set screw, I have a screwdriver set with tons of bits so I had the small enough size but most people don't, you could perhaps switch to a philips and then most would have a bit or include a screw driver. Or an even better idea, WHY NOT SEND IT WITH BIT INSTALLED?  And I had a difficult time trying to use the letter template, I just got frustrated. The bit that is included is great and I was able to lable my tools but when the DIAMOND BIT, I was very pleased, I am able to mark my tools no matter how hard with my last name in a nice clean cursive with out fighting the bit bounce from hardened steel.  The instructions are also sorely lacking in detail.  Had those issues been not been there I would have given it five stars.  How about a little compartment on the tool to store extra bits?   \n",
