       "1004332  Quality mica powder; I use it for glitter tattoos.  The shine is vibrant, and it is the perfect pearl color.  The only reason I took off a star was for the price, but if you are looking for a good mica this is a great one.  I would recommend a cheaper glitter if you are only using it for glitter tattoos though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
